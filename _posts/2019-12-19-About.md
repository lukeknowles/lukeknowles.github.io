I'm a self-taught full stack developer currently attending Western Washington University to earn my B.S. in Computer Science. I got my start in programming when I was 13 by learning how to reverse-engineer and modify PC & Xbox 360 games so that I could understand how they worked behind the scenes. From that point on I spent time learning about many different fields of development including software, games, mobile apps, robotics, and websites.

These days, most of my focus is based around the entire process of web development and deployment: setting up fresh VPSs; configuring firewalls, DNS records, SSL certifications, &  virtual hosts; writing the backend functionality of sites & RESTful APIs; and designing elegant & responsive user interfaces.

Here are a few of the languages, frameworks, and tools I'm familiar with and/or use regularly:
* Web Development
    - PHP, Node.js, Socket.IO, MySQL
    - Bootstrap, Semantic UI, PixiJS, HTML5/CSS/JS
* Software Development
    - C#, C++, Java

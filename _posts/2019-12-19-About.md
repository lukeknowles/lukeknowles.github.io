I'm a self-taught full stack developer currently attending Western Washington University to earn my B.S. in Computer Science. I started programming with C# when I was 13 by learning how to reverse-engineer and modify PC & Xbox 360 games so that I could understand how they worked. From that point on I spent time experimenting with many different fields of development including software, games, mobile apps, robotics, and websites.

These days, most of my focus is around web development. I'm well versed throughout the entire process of building and deploying websites: managing VPSs, configuring firewalls & SSL certs; developing the backend archietectures of web apps & APIs; and designing elegant & responsive user interfaces with popular frameworks such as Bootstrap.

Here are a few of the languages, frameworks, and tools I'm familiar with and/or use regularly:
* Web Development
    - PHP, Node.js, Socket.IO, MySQL
    - Bootstrap, Semantic UI, PixiJS, HTML5/CSS/JS
* Software Development
    - C#, C++, Java
* Mobile Development
    - React Native
